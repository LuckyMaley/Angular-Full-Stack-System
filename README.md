## Description
Instant Order is an e-commerce system that offers customers quality clothes at low cost. Customers can navigate through various categories in the system to view different products catered to by Instant Order. Admins can manage products and customer orders.
The system will have a clear navigation menu for easy browsing through product categories. The system will have a fast and accurate search functionality, allowing customers to find products quickly. Moreover, the system will have filters and sorting options to refine search results based on price, brand, or category criteria.
The system will have well-organised product listings displaying key information such as product name, price, and availability. The system will include product ratings and reviews to help users make informed purchase decisions. Customers will be able to add items to their cart without navigating away from the product page, and they can add products to their Wishlist.
The system will integrate user accounts to store payment and shipping details for seamless checkout. Moreover, it will consist of a streamlined checkout process with minimal steps to complete an order. Customers and Admins will be able to view orders and manage shipping addresses from their account dashboard.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
